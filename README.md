# Why and What is PeirceGen

THIS FILE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION -- talk to Andrew and Kevin. Current not useful for anyone else.

- MOTIVATION: 
- TECHNICAL PROBLEM: What is the specific hard and interesting technical problem for which we provide a solution in this paper
- STATE OF ART AND GAPS: 
- GOALS:
- APPROACH:
- PeirceGen is driven by a configuration file. See for example the Grammar or EmptyGrammer files. Each of these files has two parts. 

The first part defines a generalized abstract syntax for physically relevant elements of code written in a variety of source languages. Our current prototype uses this mechanism to define an abstract syntax for physically relevant code in C++. The intent is that it could eventually be retargeted to handle CPS code in some other languages, e.g., Java. 

The second part of each of these files

- CONCLUSIONS:
- FUTURE WORK:




Andrew: TODO.

OTHER IDEAS

- How does choice of programming language and libraries affect presence or absence of physical type errors in CPS code? For example does choosing between tf and eigen significantly affect the presence or absence of such errors, and if so, how?
